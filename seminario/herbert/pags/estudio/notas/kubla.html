      XANADU did Kubla Khan<br>
      A stately pleasure dome decree:Where Alph, the sacred river, ran through 
      caverns measureless to man down to a sunless sea.So twice five miles of 
      fertile groundWith walls and towers were girdled round: and there were gardens 
      bright with sinuous rills,Where blossomed many an incense-bearing tree; 
      and here were forests ancient as the hills, Enfolding sunny spots of greenery. 
      But Oh! that deep romantic chasm which slantedDown the green hill athwart 
      a cedarn cover!A savage place! as holy as enchanted As ever beneath a waning 
      moon was haunted by woman wailing for her demon-lover! and from this chasm, 
      with ceaseless turmoil seething, as if this earth in fast thick pants were 
      breathing, a might fountain momently was forced: amid whose swift half-intermitted 
      burst huge fragments vaulted like rebounding hail,Or chaffy grain beneath 
      the thresher's flail: and 'mid these dancing rocks at once and ever it flung 
      up momently the sacred river. Five miles meandering with a mazy motion through 
      wood and dale the sacred river ran,Then reached the caverns measureless 
      to man, and sank in tumult to a lifeless ocean: And 'mid this tumult Kubla 
      heard from far ancestral voices prophesying war! the shadow of the dome 
      of pleasure floated midway on the waves;Where was heard the mingled measure 
      from the fountain and the caves. It was a miracle of rare device, a sunny 
      pleasure-dome with caves of ice! A damsel with a dulcimerIn a vision once 
      I saw:It was an Abyssinian maid,And on her dulcimer she played, singing 
      of Mount Abora. Could I revive within meHer symphony and song,To such a 
      deep delight 'twould win me, that with music loud and long,I would build 
      that dome in air, that sunny dome! those caves of ice! and all who heard 
      would see them there, and all who should cry, Beware! Beware!His flashing 
      eyes, his floating hair!Weave a circle round him thrice, and close your 
      eyes with holy dread,For he on honey-dew hath fed, and drunk the milk of 
      Paradise.</span></font></td>
